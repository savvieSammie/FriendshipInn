# Hotel Landing Page
FriendshipInn is a landing page project I did in Html and css. This project allowed me practice my skills in websites design and it's very interesting.
I'm excited to keep this project in my repo!

# Tools used
1. Html
2. css
3. getwaves.io ( getwaves.io is a very helpful website to visit when creating websites. they help to get waves in SVG saving you the stress in creating it yourself. work smart!)
4. visual studio code
